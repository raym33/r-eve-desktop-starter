# Roadmap

AI Native OS is a local-first automation console for personal computers. The roadmap prioritizes trust, clarity, and useful vertical workflows before broad agent autonomy.

## Who it is for

AI Native OS targets non-technical solo professionals (freelancers and small-business owners) who want to save time on everyday tasks: drafting simple emails, messaging, organizing and saving documents, light databases, client notes, and basic legal/admin lookups. The goal is that a user can ask for something in plain language and the workbench does it, or transparently tries and shows its work. It deliberately stays simpler than general-purpose agent frameworks: fewer knobs, plain-language intents, and visible, reviewable actions over raw autonomy.

## Phase 1: Local Foundation

- LM Studio as the default local model endpoint.
- Eve runtime with streaming and tool calls.
- `raym33/r` catalog bridge.
- Visual skill explorer.
- Permission summary and blocked sensitive skills.
- Session tool history.
- Guided PDF workbench.
- Skill Forge draft generator.

Status: implemented in this starter.

## Phase 2: Professional Document Workflows

- Workspace folder (`~/AI-Native-OS` with Inbox/Outputs/Reports/OCR/Receipts/Drafts/Logs) created on demand; `workspace-info` reports it. Opt-in `R_BRIDGE_WORKSPACE_ONLY` keeps file paths inside the workspace (plus `R_BRIDGE_WORKSPACE_ALLOW` dirs). **Implemented.**
- Run receipts: every executed tool call writes a JSON receipt to `<workspace>/Receipts` and appends to `Logs/receipts.jsonl` (tool, params, paths, status, timestamp, approved). **Implemented.**
- File picker with scoped folders.
- Drag-and-drop PDF intake.
- Result previews for generated PDFs.
- OCR language presets.
- Batch PDF actions.

## Phase 2.5: Skill Forge

- Detect missing capabilities after catalog search.
- Generate draft skill packages under `skill-drafts/`.
- Include manifest, code skeleton, tests, and approval checklist.
- Classify permissions before implementation.
- Require human approval before installation.
- Add reusable templates for document, web, file, data, and code skills.
- Reviewed install pipeline: `list-drafts`, `inspect-draft`, `approve-draft`, `install-draft`. Installs copy a draft package into `installed-skills/` without ever importing or executing it; sensitive skills require explicit allowance, approval snapshots the signed permission profile, and draft names are validated against path traversal. **Implemented.**

## Phase 3: Research Workflows

- Firecrawl integration for page extraction. **Implemented (optional).**
- Source cards with title, URL, snippet, provider, quality, rank, and fetch status. **Implemented.**
- `web_research`: search, read top sources, and return cited research material. **Implemented.**
- First-screen Web Research actions for quick, deep, and site-specific research. **Implemented.**
- Save research notes as Markdown under the workspace. **Implemented (v1).**
- Research Collections dashboard for saved Markdown notes. **Implemented (v1).**
- Export to PDF and clipboard-safe text.
- Better handling for weak fallback search providers.

## Phase 4: Permission System

- Confirmation gate (bridge level): outward-facing and irreversible R tools (e.g. `email.send_email`, social posts, HTTP writes) never auto-execute. The bridge returns a `confirmationRequired` preview with a plain-language summary, and the tool runs only when the caller repeats the call with `confirm: true`. The guarded set is additive and cannot be weakened by configuration. **Implemented (v1).**
- Real human-in-the-loop gating (UI level): guarded R tools are wired through Eve's native `needsApproval`, so the runtime pauses before execution and the UI shows an approval card with a plain-language summary and Approve / Cancel buttons. The model cannot bypass it; the composer is locked until the user responds. **Implemented.**
- Per-tool permission prompts.
- Allow once, allow for session, always allow, deny.
- Workspace folder allowlist.
- Sensitive action preview before execution.
- Audit log and replay controls.

## Phase 5: Power User Surface

- Browser-use for interactive browser tasks.
- Local file automations.
- Multi-step task templates.
- Tool favorites.
- Model profile presets for LM Studio, Ollama, and remote APIs.

## Design Principles

- Minimal by default, inspectable when needed.
- Buttons describe actions; tooltips explain consequences.
- Never hide tool execution from the user.
- Never install generated skills automatically.
- Preserve original files unless explicitly told otherwise.
- Keep the model context focused by searching tools instead of loading every capability.
